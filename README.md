# PEEC internship

This repository contains some of the code I'm working on while being part of the PEEC internship at CAUP.
The main project has the goal to use MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analysis to improve the uncertainties on the measures of velocities of stars - with the final goal of setting constraints on dark matter present on dwarf galaxies.
