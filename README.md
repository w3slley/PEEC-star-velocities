# PEEC project at CAUP

This repository contains the resulting code produced on the PEEC 2020 internship at CAUP.
The main project has the goal to use MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to improve the uncertainties on the measurement of velocities of stars - with the final goal of setting constraints on dark matter present on ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.
